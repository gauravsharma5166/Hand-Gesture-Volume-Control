# Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control
Hand Gesture-Based Volume Control is a Python project that utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe to detect hand gestures and control the system volume dynamically. This interactive system tracks specific hand landmarks and translates gestures into volume adjustment commands, offering a touchless way to control audio levels.
